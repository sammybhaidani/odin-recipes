    <p>Try this easy recipe for Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, which is Italian for spaghetti with garlic and oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>8 to 10 cloves garlic
        </li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt

        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley

        </li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water. Add salt when it has boiled and add the pasta. Once the pasta has cooked to al dente (look at the package instructions), reserve a cup of the pasta water for the sauce and drain.</li>
        <li>Slice the garlic into thin slivers (as thin as you can).</li>
        <li>Mince the parsley.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a large pot (the same one you cooked the pasta in, if you wish) and cook on medium heat. Add half of the garlic and saute until just fragrant. Then add in the salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and chopped parsley. Cook for another minute. Just be careful not to overcook or over toast the garlic. This can lessen the garlic flavor and can make the garlic taste bitter.</li>
        <li>Add half a cup of the reserved pasta water, the pasta and the remaining garlic. Toss and cook for another 2 minutes or until it is all heated through. Add in more pasta water if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the parmesan cheese and more salt to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
